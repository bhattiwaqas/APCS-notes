     Rules for naming variable
     1. Names must not be a reserved word
     aka... cant be a BLUE word like class, new, this, for etc.
     2. Must start with a letter, underscore, or a $
     *we use lowercase as convention
     *we use Uppercase for filenames
     3. Can use numbers, but no spaces or () allowed
     *should be relatively short
     *camelCase... a way to combine two words
     * i.e. shipWeight - makes it easy to read shipweight
     4. Names should make what it is your program does more clear
     *BAD-- t2 = (t1 - f)*5/9
     *Better -- tempCel = (tempFar - freezeFar) * 5/9
